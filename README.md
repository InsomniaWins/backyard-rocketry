# Backyard Rocketry

Open source voxel-based Minecraft-inspired sandbox game built with LWJGL in Java.

## PLEASE READ
Currently in broken state due to time restraints, so do not expect to get it working out of box. I was in the middle of working on restructuring the game when I broke my arm. I am now in the middle of a semester and working on another project, so the program will not work for now.

The goal of this project is to make a game with most of the features from Minecraft with faster speeds. This will likely not include features such as smooth lighting, mod support, detailed lighting shaders, etc. It will focus on core mechanics and features rather than quality-of-life bloaty mechanics.

## Compilation

To compile/run the project, import to IntelliJ as a maven project. Then add a run configuration (if there is not already one). Dependencies should be automatically resolved as the only dependency is LWJGL.
